# Totally-Unbiased-Pong
My first ever game, Totally Unbiased Pong

This is the first version, "version Alpha". It currently lacks a lot, but it works and that is what matters for now. With plenty of features in mind, such as a menu screen as well as better ball "bounce". I believe that this project will be ready in two to three more versions, and as such, I can readily release it to the public. This is one of my projects that I plan on improving all the time, implementing newer and newer techniques as I learn them. After all, you only learn by applying (at least that is the case with me).
